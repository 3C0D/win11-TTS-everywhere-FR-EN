# 🗣️ TTS Reader - Text-to-Speech

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Install voices first!

**For the application to work correctly, install Windows TTS voices:**

**Windows Settings** → "Time & language" → "Voices" → Add **French (France)** and **English (United States)** → Install each voice → Test them

The application automatically detects all SAPI voices available on your system.

## 🚀 How it works

Double-click **tts.exe** to launch the application. An icon appears in the system tray.

**Right-click on the icon** → Menu with quick shortcuts and "Run at startup" to start with Windows

**Basic usage:**
- **Select text** anywhere (or copy without selection)
- **Win+Y** → Start reading (also stops it)
- Use **shortcuts** or **interface** to control

**Practical tip:** Selection takes priority over clipboard. For example, with an LLM, you can copy the entire response then select just a part to read only that portion.
