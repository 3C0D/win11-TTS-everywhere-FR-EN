# 🗣️ TTS Reader - Text-to-Speech

**📁 French help available:** [HELP_FR.md](HELP_FR.md) (Aide en français)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Install voices first!

**For the application to work properly, install Windows TTS voices:**

**Windows Settings** → "Time & language" → "Speech" → Add **French (France)** and **English (United States)** → Install each voice → Test them

The application automatically detects all SAPI voices available on your system.

## 🚀 How it works

Double-click **tts.exe** to launch the application. An icon appears in the system tray.

**Right-click the tray icon** → Menu with quick shortcuts and "Run at startup" to launch with Windows

**Basic usage:**
- **Select text** anywhere (or copy it without selection)
- **Win+Y** → Starts reading (and stops it too)
- Use **shortcuts** or the **interface** to control playback

**Handy tip:** Selection always takes priority over clipboard. For example, with an LLM, you can copy the entire response then select just a part to read only that section.
