; ReadingController.ahk
; Module for reading logic: paragraph navigation, start/stop reading, etc.

#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0

; Functions to be implemented:
; - StartReading
; - StopReading (wrapper if needed)
; - NextParagraph
; - PreviousParagraph
; - ReadText
; - etc.

; Example stub (to be filled with logic moved from main and HotkeyManager):

StartReading(text, lang := "AUTO") {
    global state, voice
    ; TODO: Split text into paragraphs, set state, start reading
}

NextParagraph() {
    global state, voice
    ; TODO: Move to next paragraph and read
}

PreviousParagraph() {
    global state, voice
    ; TODO: Move to previous paragraph and read
}

ReadText(lang := "AUTO") {
    global state, voice
    ; TODO: Main reading logic
}

; Add other functions as needed
